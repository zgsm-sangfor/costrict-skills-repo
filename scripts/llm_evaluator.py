SCORING RUBRIC — apply strictly. Each level describes OBSERVABLE behavior.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
coding_relevance (1-5)
Overall question: Where does this tool sit in the
"write code → test code → debug code → deploy code" pipeline?

  5 — Tool directly operates on code or code execution environments
      Criteria: Without this tool, a developer cannot write code or run it.
      Examples: compiler, debugger, IDE plugin, language server, package manager,
               database client (writing SQL), testing framework
      Note: Not everything "developers use daily" is 5 — must operate on code itself.

  4 — Tool directly participates in dev workflow but does NOT operate on code itself
      Criteria: Without this tool, code can still be written but dev efficiency drops significantly.
      Examples: code linter, CI/CD pipeline, Git tool, code review assistant,
               API testing tool, container orchestration (K8s)
      ┌ Boundary vs 5: linter inspects code but doesn't run it;
      └              CI/CD deploys code but doesn't write it.

  3 — Tool is dev-related but developers can code normally without it
      Criteria: Developers "use this sometimes" but not "while coding."
      Examples: documentation generator, API design tool (Swagger),
               project management (Jira/Linear), design viewer
      ┌ Boundary vs 4: Remove Jira, code still gets written.
      └              Remove linter, not so.

  2 — Tool has only indirect relation to programming; primary audience is NOT developers
      Criteria: Regular people use this tool too; developers are a small fraction of users.
      Examples: Slack/Discord bot, general note-taking, file manager,
               calendar, email client
      Note: "MCP server for Slack" is 2, not 4 — Slack itself is not a dev tool.

  1 — Completely unrelated to software development
      Criteria: Would never appear in any dev workflow.
      Examples: cooking, travel, sports, fitness, SEO/marketing,
               social media management, persona simulation ("Act as Bill Gates")

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
content_quality (1-5)
Overall question: How much can you understand about this tool
just from its description?

  5 — Description tells you what it does, when to use it, what it needs,
      and what its scope is. After reading, you could decide to install or skip.
      Criteria: 100+ chars, includes purpose, use cases, and prerequisites.

  4 — Description clearly explains what the tool does and when to use it,
      but missing some details (prerequisites, scope, limitations).
      Criteria: 2-3 sentences covering the main functionality.

  3 — Description gives you a general idea but you'd need to check the README.
      Criteria: 50-100 chars, answers "what" but not "when" or "why."
      ┌ Boundary vs 4: if you'd need to visit the repo to decide
      └              whether to use it, it's 3 not 4.

  2 — Description is very short (<50 chars) or vague.
      You get a topic but not what the tool actually does.
      Examples: "A tool for X", "MCP server for Y" with no further detail.
      ┌ Boundary vs 3: if you can't tell WHAT it does (only the topic),
      └              it's 2.

  1 — No real description. Placeholder, single dash, single word, or empty.
      Examples: "-", "build", "One sentence - what this skill does"

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
specificity (1-5, MCP/Skill only)
Overall question: How narrow is the problem this tool solves?

  5 — Solves exactly one well-defined problem.
      You can describe the tool's scope in one sentence.
      Examples: "PostgreSQL query optimizer", "Jest snapshot testing helper"
      Criteria: Tool does one thing, and you know exactly what it is.

  4 — Focused scope covering a closely related set of features.
      Examples: "Database management toolkit (schema, queries, migrations)",
               "React testing utilities"
      ┌ Boundary vs 5: does 2-3 related things instead of exactly 1.

  3 — Moderate scope — covers a domain area but not narrowly focused.
      Examples: "Full-stack web development helper",
               "Cloud infrastructure manager"
      ┌ Boundary vs 4: scope spans multiple categories
      └              (testing + deployment + monitoring).

  2 — Very broad scope, tries to do many different things.
      Examples: "AI assistant for everything",
               "Multi-purpose development toolkit"

  1 — Scope is completely unclear or claims to do everything.
      Examples: "General assistant", "All-in-one tool"

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
CALIBRATION EXAMPLES (use these as scoring anchors):

Low-score examples:
- "Chef Recipe MCP" with desc "Find and share recipes"
  → coding_relevance=1, content_quality=2, specificity=4
  Reason: cooking is unrelated to dev; description states topic only.

- "Debate Coach" prompt with desc "Improve your debating skills"
  → coding_relevance=1, content_quality=2
  Reason: debating is not software development.

- "Act as Elon Musk" prompt with desc "Simulate Elon Musk persona"
  → coding_relevance=1, content_quality=1
  Reason: persona simulation is never coding; description is a placeholder.

- "SEO Analysis MCP" with desc "Analyze website SEO metrics, check backlinks, keyword density, and generate improvement reports for better search rankings"
  → coding_relevance=1, content_quality=4, specificity=4
  Reason: SEO is marketing, not dev — good description doesn't raise coding_relevance.

- MCP with description "-"
  → content_quality=1
  Reason: empty/placeholder description.

Mid-score examples:
- "Swagger API Design MCP" with desc "Design and validate OpenAPI specs with auto-generated documentation and mock servers"
  → coding_relevance=3, content_quality=4, specificity=4
  Reason: dev-adjacent (API design) but you can code without it; description is clear.

- "Jira Integration Skill" with desc "Create and manage Jira issues"
  → coding_relevance=3, content_quality=3, specificity=4
  Reason: project management is dev-related but not part of coding itself.

High-score examples (with justification):
- "PostgreSQL optimization rule" with desc "Analyzes slow queries and suggests index improvements for PostgreSQL databases, with EXPLAIN plan parsing"
  → coding_relevance=5, content_quality=4, specificity=5
  Why 5 not 4: directly operates on database queries — code itself.

- "ESLint configuration skill" with desc "Generate and maintain ESLint configs for TypeScript projects with auto-fix support"
  → coding_relevance=4, content_quality=4, specificity=4
  Why 4 not 5: inspects code but doesn't run or write it.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
ANTI-INFLATION RULES — apply these AFTER initial scoring:

1. MCP NAMING TRAP: "MCP server for X" — score based on what X is,
   not the fact that it's an MCP server. "MCP server for Slack" → coding_relevance=2.

2. KEYWORD TRAP: Having API/SDK/server keywords in the description
   does NOT automatically make something a dev tool. Evaluate the actual functionality.

3. PERSONA SIMULATION: Any "Act as X" / role-play / persona prompt
   → coding_relevance=1, always. Even "Act as a senior developer" is 1.

4. SINGLE-SENTENCE DESCRIPTION CAP: If the description is a single generic sentence,
   content_quality MUST be ≤ 3. Never 4 or 5.

5. STRICTNESS CALIBRATION: Be STRICT with 4 and 5. Most resources are 2-3.
   A 4 requires direct participation in coding workflow.
   A 5 requires operating on code itself."""
